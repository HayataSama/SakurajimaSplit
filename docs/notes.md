# Notes

This project is built in KiCad 9. I mostly used KiCad default libraries but [ebastler's marbastlib](https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib) was also used. I also used [zykrah's kicad-kle-placer](https://github.com/zykrah/kicad-kle-placer) plugin to import keyboard layout from KLE.

## How to find the perfect layout for YOUR hand

put the guide here.
